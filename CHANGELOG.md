Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)

---

## [0.6.6] — 2026-03-01

### Added
- `uninstall.sh` — script de désinstallation complet : arrête tous les services (systemd/launchd), supprime les fichiers de service, les données des instances (`~/.openclaw-*/`), les données claw-pilot (`~/.claw-pilot/`), le symlink binaire et le répertoire d'installation
- Modes `--dry-run` (affiche ce qui serait supprimé), `--yes` (non-interactif), `--keep-data` (garde les données instances et claw-pilot)
- Détection automatique du répertoire d'installation via le symlink `claw-pilot` (fallback `CLAW_PILOT_INSTALL_DIR` ou `/opt/claw-pilot`)
- Fallback sudo pour les suppressions nécessitant des droits élevés (symlink dans `/usr/local/bin`, repo dans `/opt/`)

---

## [0.6.5] — 2026-02-28

### Fixed
- Provisioner now rolls back all created artefacts on failure — if `claw-pilot create` fails mid-provisioning (after directories or service files were created), it automatically removes the state dir, service file, and registry entries instead of leaving orphaned state

---

## [0.6.4] — 2026-02-28

### Fixed
- `claw-pilot init` now shows a clear actionable message when OpenClaw installation fails — includes the manual install command and instructs the user to re-run `claw-pilot init` afterward

---

## [0.6.3] — 2026-02-28

### Fixed
- `install.sh` now sources `~/.zshrc` after `pnpm setup` (in addition to `.bashrc`/`.profile`) — fixes silent PATH failure on macOS where zsh is the default shell since Catalina
- `install.sh` OpenClaw detection now includes `/opt/homebrew/bin/openclaw` and `/usr/local/bin/openclaw` — aligns with the paths checked by `openclaw-cli.ts` on macOS
- `install.sh` now checks for required build tools (`cc`, `make`, `python3`) before `pnpm install` and prints a clear hint if any are missing (needed to compile `better-sqlite3` native bindings)

---

## [0.6.2] — 2026-02-28

### Fixed
- `claw-pilot create` now detects missing OpenClaw before entering the wizard and offers to install it automatically — instead of throwing an opaque `OPENCLAW_NOT_FOUND` error mid-provisioning

---

## [0.6.1] — 2026-02-27

### Fixed
- Google provider now writes `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env` instead of `GOOGLE_API_KEY` — instances created with Google Gemini were failing to start because OpenClaw expects `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- `openclaw.json` `meta.lastTouchedVersion` bumped to `2026.2.27` to match current OpenClaw release
- Anthropic model catalog corrected — removed non-existent `claude-opus-4-6` / `claude-sonnet-4-6` model IDs, replaced with real catalog (`claude-opus-4-5`, `claude-opus-4-1`, `claude-sonnet-4-5`, `claude-haiku-4-5`)

---

## [0.6.0] — 2026-02-27

### Added
- Agent team export/import via `.team.yaml` files — snapshot and restore a full agent team (agents, prompts, spawn links) across instances
- Export button in the agents builder — generates a `.team.yaml` with all agents, their workspace files, and spawn relationships
- Import dialog in the agents builder — validates and applies a `.team.yaml` into any instance, creating agents, writing workspace files, and wiring spawn links
- Verbose import validation — detailed error messages when the YAML schema is invalid or agents are misconfigured

### Fixed
- Import now correctly restores spawn links in `openclaw.json` (`list[].subagents.allowAgents`) — previously links were lost after sync
- Workspace files (AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, etc.) are now written to the correct path (`workspaces/workspace-{id}/`) matching the convention used by agent-sync and discovery
- `main` spawn links are now written to a dedicated `list[]` entry instead of `defaults.subagents`, which was rejected by OpenClaw and caused the instance to become unhealthy

---

## [0.5.0] — 2026-02-26

### Added
- macOS support — claw-pilot now runs natively on macOS using launchd (LaunchAgents)
- `launchd-generator.ts` — generates `.plist` files for OpenClaw instances and the dashboard service
- `getServiceManager()` in `platform.ts` — abstracts systemd vs launchd dispatch
- launchd helpers: `getLaunchdDir()`, `getLaunchdLabel()`, `getLaunchdPlistPath()`, `getDashboardLaunchdPlistPath()`
- macOS OpenClaw detection paths: `~/.npm-global/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`
- macOS-aware PATH in `openclaw-cli.ts` (includes `/opt/homebrew/bin`)
- `xdg.ts` guard — returns empty string on macOS (XDG_RUNTIME_DIR is Linux-only)

### Changed
- `lifecycle.ts`, `provisioner.ts`, `destroyer.ts`, `health.ts`, `discovery.ts`, `dashboard-service.ts` — all dispatch on `getServiceManager()` (systemd on Linux, launchd on macOS)
- `systemd_unit` field stores launchd label (`ai.openclaw.<slug>`) on macOS
- `status.ts` — renamed "Systemd" label to "Service" for platform-neutral display

### Removed
- Nginx support — fully removed from code, wizard, DB schema, types, tests, and docs
- `nginx-generator.ts` deleted
- DB migration v4 removes `nginx_domain` column from `instances` table

---

## [0.4.0] — 2026-02-26

### Added
- Real-time instance monitoring via WebSocket change-detection (push on state change only)
- Live instance detail panel — auto-refreshes health, logs, and status without polling
- Batched health checks — parallel port scan reduces dashboard load time

### Changed
- Dashboard service migrated to `ServerConnection` abstraction (no more raw `child_process` calls)
- `execFile` migration complete — all shell ops go through `conn.execFile` for future SSH compatibility
- `detect()` in `openclaw-cli` uses `conn.exists()` instead of `--version` subprocess (no TTY required)
- Extended PATH in `detect()` and `run()` for systemd non-interactive context

### Fixed
- `/api/instances` response now merges DB fields (state, telegram_bot, etc.) into instance objects
- `state: undefined` no longer returned when DB row exists but runtime state is unknown

---

## [0.3.3] — 2026-02-26 — First public release
